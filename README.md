MusCat
======
This is my first project on RoR. If you will see some bad practises or antipatterns, please tell me about them.
What is it?
======
MusCat is a simplest music catalog. Right now you can:
  - manage artists, albums, genres, songs, posts, comments and reviews
  - vote for genre to artist (once per combination artist-genre-user)
  - view related to genre artists
  - try guest account before signing up

In nearest future i want to add:
  - js to comments
  - token fields for genres to artists
  - rating to reviews
  - avatars to users
  - additional params to artists and albums
  - mb additional params to users
  - pictures to posts
  - some minor fixes in the whole project
